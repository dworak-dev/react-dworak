# Features

This repo template is meant to fit all of my usual development needs, taking my startup time to near zero. The less friction when starting a project the more I can focus on doing the important things, writing useful code and not just writing boilerplate. This template will be evolving as time goes, as more features are added.

### Monorepo

After building several react projects there is no doubt in my mind that a monorepo is not a nice to have but necessary. Projects are rarely a just once page and even then having a strong monorepo structure around it doesn't hurt. Monorepo helps me to keep all common assets, components, and other common code centralized.
